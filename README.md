# School Bot
SchoolGirl is a bot designed to help with school assignments by grouping Discord users together based on their institution and class.

This project is to improve my knowledge on the following topics:
    + Serialization<br>
    + Reading / Writing to files<br>
    + Advanced Object Oreinted Programing concepts<br>
    + Threads<br>
    + API usage<br>
    + Java Data Structures<br>
    + Exception Handling<br>

This project would not be possible without **Gavin H.** and **Ryan L.** Thank you!
